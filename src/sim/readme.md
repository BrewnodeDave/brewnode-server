To simulate hardware signals, the i2c and temperature drivers are replaced with equivalent APIs that do not require physical devices. 

The simulation is not of the brewery but rather the brewing process, which consists of modelling volumes, flow rates and temperatures based upon actuator activity. For example, opening valves affects volumes and turning the heater on affects temperatures.
